# Windows Pool Structures
 My love for learning Windows internals continues.

You are free to use these structures. Though, I would appreciate credits to this repository (for the sake of motivation).

Knowledge should not be locked away behind a license or a pay wall.

### SIDE NOTE
Yeah, I'm aware that I did not add any structures today. I promise I will get off my lazy bum-ass and get some structures mapped out tomorrow, lol.
